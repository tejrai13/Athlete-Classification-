# Athlete Classification

This project was part of an open-ended data analysis project from my DS 740 Data Mining & Machine Learning class (UWLAX MS in Data Science)

I chose to analyze an Australian Athelete data set and build a classifier model that would classify what sport groups a person would fall under based on the predictor variables in the data set.

Data Preperation & Cleaning (step 1):

The initial part of .rmd file involves exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and preperation to ensure the quality of analysis and prepare for fitting to our two models. 

Modeling (step 2):

Step 2 involves fitting the data to a KNN model and Random Forest Model and fine tuning for the parameters required in both models. This step includes cross-validation and a for-loop outer fold conducted on both models. Here we find the best model to classify athletes into sport groups by comparing the accuracies and confusion matrix. 

Analysis (step 3):

Step 3 involves identifying the important variables and examining their relationships to the response variable.
